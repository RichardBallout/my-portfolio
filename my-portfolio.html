    <p>Hello there, my name is Richard and I live in Ramsbottom. I work as an SEO content writer, which basically means
        I try to make Google like the pages I write and reward me
        by ranking these pages highly in their search engine listings for certain keywords and phrases related to the
        content of the page.</p>

    <p>I studied Contemporary History and Politics at university to prepare me well for a career in tech. I'm currently
        studying with Manchester Codes on their Software Engineer Fast Track Course.</p>

    <p>You can find my GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/RichardBallout">here.</a></p>

        <h2>What is SEO?
    </center>
    </h2>

    <p>SEO stands for <b>search engine optimisation</b>. There are many different factors which influence where a page
        ranks on
        search engines when you make a search for something.
        SEO is the practice of trying to get a page to rank highly in a search engine for certain keywords and phrases.
    </p>

    <h3>What influences search engine rankings?</h3>
    <p>Getting a page to rank highly in a search engine is not as simple as just writing the content and, wabam, high
        ranking.</p>

    <p>Factors which influence search engine rankings include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The domain authority of the site. This basically means how reputable the site is.</li>
        <li>Quality backlinks from other sites. Google will reward you if your page has been linked to from other
            reputable sites.</li>
        <li>The inclusion of certain keywords and phrases which are relevant to the topic of the page.</li>
        <li>How active the site is in terms of publishing content.</li>
        <li>The alt tags on images in the content.</li>
        <li>The title and meta decription on the page.</li>
        <li>The code behind the site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What attracted you to coding?</h2>
    <p>What attracted me most to coding is the problem solving aspect of it and the intellectual challenge. I'm sure it
        will be very satisfying to devise innovative solutions to complex problems. </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <center>
        <h3>Health and Fitness</h3>
    </center>
    <p>I enjoy keeping fit and healthy and experimenting with different forms of exercise. I have dabbled
        in yoga, pilates, qigong, boxing and taekwondo, to name a few. Also, in my younger days I was an extremely keen
        footballer and played
        for Blackburn Rovers academy for two years. I recently discovered the joys of running which I want to explore
        further. Marathon anyone?</p>


    <center>
        <h3>Travelling</h3>
    </center>
    <p>I have travelled quite a lot, though not so much over the past few years. I have visited twenty countries and
        been
        to four continents (and counting). My most memorable trip was a two-month visit to India and Nepal which
        included trekking in the
        beatuiful Langtang Valley area of Nepal,
        seeing a wild tiger, memorable visits to the Taj Mahal and Golden Temple, and doing yoga in the so-called "yoga
        capital of the world", Rishikesh.
