            <p>Hello there, my name is Richard and I live in Ramsbottom. I work as an SEO content writer, so I spend all
                day trying to get Google to like the pages I write.</p>

            <p>I'm currently studying with Manchester Codes on their Software Engineer Fast Track Course.</p>

        <h2>What attracted you to coding?</h2>
        <p>The problem solving aspect of it and the intellectual challenge. I'm sure that the process of devising a
            solution to a complex problem and seeing the project through to completion will be extremely satisfying.

        <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
        <p>SEO stands for <b>search engine optimisation</b>. SEO is the process of optimising a page/site so that it
            ranks highly in search engines for certain keywords and
            phrases. </p>


        <p>There are many different factors which influence where a page ranks on search engines for certain keywords
            and phrases. Interestingly, the coding behind a site has a significant impact on search engine rankings, and
            much more than many people realise.</p>

            <h2>What are my hobbies?</h2>

            <h3>Health and Fitness</h3>

            <p>I enjoy keeping fit and healthy and experimenting with different forms of exercise. I have dabbled
                in yoga, pilates, qigong, boxing and taekwondo, to name a few. Also, in my younger days I was an
                extremely
                keen
                footballer and played for Blackburn Rovers academy for two years.</p>

            <p>I recently discovered the joys of running which I want to explore further. Marathon anyone?</p>

            <h3>Travelling</h3>

            <p>I have visited twenty countries and been to four continents (and counting).</p>

            <p></p>My most memorable trip was a two-month visit to India and Nepal which
            included trekking in the
            beatuiful Langtang Valley area of Nepal,
            seeing a wild tiger, memorable visits to the Taj Mahal and Golden Temple, and doing yoga in the so-called
            "yoga
            capital of the world", Rishikesh.</p>
