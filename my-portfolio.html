<center><h1><span style="color:blue">Richard Ballout - About Me</span></center></h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Richard and I live in Ramsbottom. I have lived in the North West of England
    all my life, apart from the odd month here and there when I've been travelling. I am of mixed heritage, half British and half Lebanese.</p>

 <p>I work as an SEO content writer, which basically means I try to make Google like the pages I write and reward me by ranking
    these pages highly in their search engine listings for certain keywords and phrases related to the content of the page. </p>

 <p>I studied Contemporary History and Politics at university to prepare me well for a career in tech.</p>

 <center><h3>Travelling</h3></center>
 <p>I have travelled quite a lot, though not so much over the past few years. I have visited twenty countries and been to four continents. My most memorable trip was a two-month visit to India and Nepal which included trekking in the beatuiful Langtang Valley area of Nepal,
    seeing a wild tiger, memorable visits to the Taj Mahal and Golden Temple, and doing yoga in the so-called "yoga capital of the world", Rishikesh.

 <center><h3>Health and Fitness</h3></center>
 <p>I enjoy keeping fit and healthy and exploring and experimenting with different forms of exercise. I have dabbled in yoga, pilates, qigong, boxing, taekwondo,
     as well as more standard forms of exercise. Also, in my younger days I was an extremely keen footballer and played for Blackburn Rovers academy for two years.
     Recently discovered the joys of running which I want to explore further.</p>

I enjoy taking Mooose for long walks in the hills around where I live.</p>

<p>I absolutely love animals. I'm one of those people who will try to stroke any dog or cat I see on the street.</p>
