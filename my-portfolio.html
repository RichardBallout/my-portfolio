    <p>Hey there! I'm Richard and I live in Ramsbottom. I have lived in the North West of England
        all my life, apart from the odd month here and there when I've been travelling.</p>

    <p>I work as an SEO content writer, which basically means I try to make Google like the pages I write and reward me
        by ranking
        these pages highly in their search engine listings for certain keywords and phrases related to the content of
        the
        page. </p>

    <p>I studied Contemporary History and Politics at university to prepare me well for a career in tech.</p>

        <h2>What is SEO?
    </center>
    </h2>

    <p>SEO stands for <b>search engine optimisation</b>. There are many different factors which influence where a page ranks on
        search engines when you make a search for something.
        SEO is the practice of trying to get a page to rank highly in a search engine for certain keywords and phrases.

    <h3>What influences search engine rankings?</h3>
    <p>Getting a page to rank highly in a search engine is not as simple as just writing the content and, wabam, high
        ranking.</p>

        <p>Factors which influence search engine rankings include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The domain authority of the site. This basically means how reputable the site is.</li>
        <li>Quality backlinks from other sites. Google will reward you if your page has been linked to from other
            reputable sites.</li>
        <li>The inclusion of certain keywords and phrases which are relevant to the topic of the page.</li>
        <li>How active the site is in terms of publishing content.</li>
        <li>The alt tags on images in the content.</li>
        <li>The title and meta decription on the page.</li>
        <li>The code behind the site.</li>
    </ul>
